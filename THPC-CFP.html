    <h2>Call for Papers - Special Issue on Memory Architectures and Systems for Modern Applications</h2>

    <HR>
    <P>Modern data centric applications, such as artifical artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, graph data analysis, IoT systems,  have emerged and been widely used in our daily life. These  applications keep raising the requirements of large capacity, high performance, low power consumption,  and high reliability for the whole memory hierarchy, which may be difficult to be satisfied by traditional memory architectures and systems. On the other hand, with the rapid advancement of memory technologies, various emerging memory technologies have been proposed to mitigate the problems mentioned above. These emerging memory technologies have the advantages of high density, low standy power, etc. However, they also face the challenges of programming overhead, limited lifetime, and reliablility issues. Thus, to leverage the uniques features and handle the limitations of these emerging memory technologies, we are expecting innovations in memory architecture and system designs. <BR>
    <BR>
    The goal of this Special Issue is to present the novel ideas, methods, as well as efforts for resolving the above challenges, and to improve the efficiency of memory architectures and systems for modern applications. Extended versions of papers published in conferences, symposiums or workshop proceedings may be permitted. Survey papers will also be considered.<BR>

    Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
